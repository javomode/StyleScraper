"# StyleScraper" 

Process:

1. Install neccessary libraries:
   * requests (to make HTTP requests)
   * selenium (can interact with webpages like a human would, which means dealing with dynamic content with JavaScript.)
   * BeautifulSoup (can only parse static HTML, which is why we need Selenium as well - to my understanding)

     By using both selenium and BeautifulSoup, we can fetch both static and dynamic content and parse it.

2. Use the Requests library to fetch webpage content and use selenium or BeatifulSoup.

3. Store to an Excel/XML file, and save for later for viewing.
